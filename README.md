# DEVPOST3
It is an Machine Learning based prototype project 
🗳️ E-Voting System Using Flask, OpenCV & Blockchain

🚀 Overview

This is a secure and transparent E-Voting System built using Flask (Python Web Framework), OpenCV (Live Face Detection), and Blockchain (Tamper-proof Voting Records). The system ensures voter authentication and immutable vote storage.

📌 Features

✅ Secure Authentication – Uses Live Face Detection for voter verification.

✅ Blockchain-Powered – Ensures tamper-proof and transparent vote records.

✅ Flask-Based Web App – User-friendly interface to cast and view votes.

✅ SQLite Database – Stores voter details securely.

✅ Real-time Vote Processing – Each vote is recorded instantly.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Backend: Flask, Python, SQLite

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Bootstrap)

Face Detection: OpenCV

Blockchain: Custom Python-based blockchain

📸 Live Face Detection (OpenCV)

To ensure secure authentication, the system uses OpenCV to detect and verify a voter’s face before allowing them to vote.

🔗 Blockchain-Based Voting

Each vote is added as a block in a simple custom blockchain, making the voting system tamper-proof and verifiable.
